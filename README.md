# TPF2-LineManager

A mod for Transport Fever 2 to automatically manage the number of buses/trams/aircraft/ships on passenger lines.

Taking into account the load-factor over time, and demand on the line, this mod will buy/sell buses/trams/aircraft/ships
accordingly, effectively increasing/decreasing capacity on a line as per the actual demand. This mod will greatly assist
in addressing the tedious micro-management of bus/tram/aircraft/ship lines when updating road/tram infrastructure,
adding more destinations, and in general updating the overall passenger transport network. The mod in fact completely
eliminates the bus/tram/aircraft/ship passenger line micro-management and will let you focus on the more fun overall
design of the transport network.

This mod can be added/removed to existing games as desired - it only measures load factor and demand and adds/removes
vehicles on applicable lines accordingly. Only live data is used.

Source code is located here: https://github.com/TommyC81/TPF2-LineManager. Created by https://github.com/TommyC81 with
contribution from https://github.com/RusteyBucket. Inspired by and uses some functionality
from https://github.com/IncredibleHannes/TPF2-Timetables.

## Quick start

1. Create a bus line.
2. Add one bus to the bus line.
3. Make sure a depot is accessible for the bus on the bus line.
4. Make sure you have cash available for buying additional buses (when the mod determines it required).

## What the mod does

* The mod will add/remove i.e. buy/sell buses (of the same type as already utilized on the line) according to line
  utilization and demand, as money permits.
* When utilization (load factor over time) goes above/below different thresholds along with excessive/insufficient
  demand on the route, a vehicle will be added/removed accordingly.
* When a vehicle is sold, it will sell the oldest vehicle on the line. The mod will additionally ensure there is at
  least 1 vehicle remaining on the line.

## What the mod does NOT do

* This mod will not fix poorly designed transports networks. If you have a bus line that has highly uneven demand along
  the route, you will have to fix that yourself - there is no software that can fix this for you. If no vehicles are
  added despite a single station being overloaded along the route - it is probably a sign of poor route design, split
  the route up into evenly balanced (demand) sections.

## Performance

* The mod takes one usage, rate and demand sample per line per in-game month.
* Every second in-game month, lines are updated to add/remove vehicles as appropriate.
* Thus, performance impact should be negligible. This has not been studied in-depth, but no effect of the
  sampling/updates has been observed in games with hundreds of lines/buses/trams/aircraft/ships.

## Untested

* If a vehicle type is no longer available (outdated) when it is time to add/buy a bus - a silent failure is assumed.

## Future plans

* No specific plans, except making this stable and add some general coding improvements as time permits.

## What you can do by mucking around in the mod file

* The `helper.lua` file contains much of the identification logic such as:
    * `helper.moreVehiclesConditions()` contains the rules that determine if there should be another vehicle added to a
      line.
    * `helper.lessVehiclesConditions()` contains the rules that determine if there are too many vehicles on a line.
    * `helper.supportedRoute()` contains the categories of vehicles supported by this mod (we're not entirely sure what
      number is what as of yet, though we're on it).
* The `linemanager.lua` file contains the execution functions that actually make things work. If you're determined, you
  can change stuff there.
    * Uncomment the line `log.setLevel(log.levels.DEBUG)` to avail additional in-game console debugging output.
* Any changes made to the code could obviously cause the game to crash on loading or on reaching the clause that breaks
  the code. Maybe even worse, who knows.

                    'Taking into account the load-factor over time, and line demand and rate, this mod will buy/sell buses/trams/aircraft/ships accordingly, effectively increasing/decreasing capacity on a line as per the actual demand.\n' ..
                    'This mod will greatly assist in addressing the tedious micro-management of bus/tram/aircraft/ship lines when updating road/tram infrastructure, adding more destinations, and in general updating the overall transport network. The mod in fact completely eliminates the bus/tram/aircraft/ship micro-management and will let you focus on the more fun overall design of the transport network.\n' ..

                    '[*]This mod can be added/removed to existing games as desired - it only measures load factor, rate, and demand, adding/removing vehicles on applicable lines accordingly. Only live data is used.\n' ..
                    '[*]This mod will by default automatically manage the number of vehicles on [u]all passenger lines utilizing buses, trams, aircraft, or ships[/u].\n' ..
                    '[*]Tested and sensible default rules are used to determine the number of required vehicles on a line. However, should this not work as desired, two options as per below are available to tweak the functionality:\n' ..
                    '[*][b](M) - MANUAL[/b]: To [u]disable automatic vehicle management[/u] on a specific line, add "[b](M)[/b]" to the name of the line (anywhere in the line name).\n' ..
                    '[*][b](R) - RATE[/b]: To [u]use alternative line rate rules[/u] for a specific line, adjusting number of vehicles strictly to ensure rate exceeds demand (this is more aggressive scaling, effectively ignoring load factor), add "[b](R)[/b]" to the name of the line (anywhere in the line name). [i]Note that this is somewhat experimental and the rules may change, please provide feedback.[/i]\n' ..

If you have a bus line that has highly uneven demand along the route, you will have to fix that yourself - there is no software that can fix this for you. If no vehicles are added despite a single station being overloaded along the route - it is probably a sign of poor route design, split the route up into evenly balanced (demand) sections.\n' ..
                    '[*]As an alternative to improving the route network, you can try using the alternative [b](R) - RATE[/b] line rules or [b](M) - MANUAL[/b] line management (see Information and and options above).\n' ..
